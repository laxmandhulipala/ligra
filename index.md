      <h3>Minimal API</h3>
      <p>
      Ligra exposes a small and simple set of primitives in its API. 
      The functional nature of these primitives makes writing and 
      reasoning about graph-algorithms easy and error-free.

      <h3>A Simple Component</h3>
      <p>
        React components implement a `render()` method that takes input data and
        returns what to display. This example uses an XML-like syntax called
        JSX. Input data that is passed into the component can be accessed by
        `render()` via `this.props`.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>JSX is optional and not required to use React.</strong> Try
        clicking on "Compiled JS" to see the raw JavaScript code produced by
        the JSX compiler.
