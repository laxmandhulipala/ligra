      <h3>Minimal</h3>
      <p>
      Ligra's API exposes a simple set of primitives
      which makes writing and reasoning about graph-algorithms easier.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="marketing-col">
      <h3>Parallel</h3>
      <p>
        Ligra's API is implicitly parallel and lets applications 
        take advantage of shared-memory parallelism.

      <h3>Lightweight</h3>
      <p>
      The entire codebase is under 2000 lines of modern C++ and can easily 
      be extended or customized.
